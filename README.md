# Magic Form
You can see the live preview of this project [here](https://ayushnagarcodes.github.io/Magic-Form/index.html).
- It is not just a simple form. It is magical. How?
  - While filling the form, if you accidentally reload the page or close the tab, you can lose all the data. But this form will
    retain the data, when it closes unexpectedly.
  - The input fields sync across multiple tabs and windows. Try opening multiple windows side-by-side and then change one of its input field. The change will be     reflected in every window.
  - A record of submitted forms is stored on the 'Hisory' page in the form of cards.
  - You can delete individual cards on the 'Hisory' page by clicking on 'Delete' button.
- It uses local storage of browsers to store form data and the history page is updated by accessing it.
- The local storage is also updated as the user deletes a card to maintain order.
- You can use the top nav bar to move between 'Form' and 'History' page.
- It was a challenging project. I learned a lot about localStorage, DOM manipulation, event listeners & array transformation.
